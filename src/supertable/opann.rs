//! MVCC OPANN maintenance for the hidden global vector cell index.

//! The user table stays time-ordered and immutable. The hidden index is a
//! derived, cell-ordered acceleration layer maintained with OPANN-style
//! logical updates expressed as append/MVCC physical swaps:
//!
//!   1. Assign incoming vectors to nearest manifest centroids with zero GETs.
//!   2. For each touched cell only: append one delta superfile (no GETs).
//!   3. Compaction merges multiple small IVF superfiles per cell toward one packed
//!      base via the standard `merge_superfiles` path.
//!   4. Locally refresh touched cell centroids and counts.
//!   5. Split overflow cells in place: partition an over-cap cell into K
//!      children (Sq8+ε capacitated k-means; K self-tuned upward from
//!      ⌈rows/cap⌉ until each child's rows route to it at nprobe=1),
//!      append the K children as one packed superfile (child 0 keeps the cell
//!      id, the rest appended), and mark the parent cell superseded in the
//!      manifest — no rewrite, no removal at split time.
//!   6. Readers, per-cell counts, merges, and split selection all skip the
//!      superseded parent; its blocks are logically dead.
//!   7. Compaction later reclaims the superseded parent's dead blocks.
//!
//! Split stays on stored Sq8+ε bytes. Row assignment dequantizes
//! manifest centroids and rows to fp32 before [`distance`]; rows are
//! re-spliced with [`encode_encoded_rows`], never decoded to full fp32 corpora.
