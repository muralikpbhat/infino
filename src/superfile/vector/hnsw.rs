//! Hierarchical navigable small-world (HNSW) proximity graph over the
//! vector rerank codecs.
//!
//! The graph is generic over a [`NodeScorer`]: the per-node distance is
//! the *only* thing the codec-specific layer exposes, so [`Hnsw::build`]
//! and [`Hnsw::search`] never see codes, dequant grids, or f32 planes —
//! only `prepare` (fold a query once) and `score` (distance from that
//! folded query to a stored node, lower = nearer). Two scorers ship:
//!
//! - [`Sq16Scorer`] — the flat 16-bit scalar codec on the fixed
//!   `[-1, 1]` cosine grid. It is a thin adapter over the existing
//!   [`Sq16Kernel`] fused `u16 → f32` dequant dot, so there is a single
//!   source of truth for the SIMD-tiered scoring math; the graph never
//!   materializes a decoded vector to score a candidate. This is the
//!   impl used in practice.
//! - [`Fp32Scorer`] — raw f32 vectors scored by a configured [`Metric`]
//!   (`distance`). Proves the graph is codec-agnostic: the same
//!   [`Hnsw::build`] / [`Hnsw::search`] drive it unchanged.
//!
//! Scores are *distances* — smaller is nearer for every metric (`−dot` for
//! Cosine/NegDot, squared distance for L2Sq).
//!
//! Layer assignment is deterministic (seeded SplitMix64), so the tower a
//! node lands on never depends on insert order. [`Hnsw::build`] then
//! inserts nodes concurrently over a rayon pool: each node's adjacency
//! sits behind its own lock, a beam reader clones a neighbor list under
//! that lock and scores outside it, and edge splices take the lock only
//! to write. Concurrency reorders inserts, so the graph is not
//! bit-identical run to run, but the seeded tower plus the diversity
//! heuristic keep walk recall stable. The finished graph is immutable and
//! searched single-threaded.
//!
//! Some items (e.g. [`Fp32Scorer`]) are exercised only by the unit tests,
//! so the module allows dead code rather than sprinkling per-item guards.

/// coordinate), with an optional second nibble plane carrying a sub-step
/// residual.
///
/// Two properties make 4 bits survivable, and both are load-bearing:
///
/// * **Rotation first.** The stored Sq16 rerank rows are UNROTATED (only
///   the 1-bit codes are rotated — `builder.rs` pass 2), and raw
///   embedding axes carry wildly uneven energy, so quantizing them at 4
///   bits wastes most of the 16 levels per axis. The structured rotation
///   (the same seeded spinner the 1-bit codes use) spreads variance
///   near-uniformly across coordinates, which is exactly what makes a
///   per-coordinate ruler meaningful at this width. Queries rotate once
///   in `prepare` (`O(dim·log dim)`, trivial next to the walk).
/// * **Fitted, not fixed.** A rotated unit vector's components are of
///   order `1/sqrt(dim)` (±0.036 at 768d) while the fixed `[-1, 1]`
///   grid's 4-bit step is `2/15 ≈ 0.133` — wider than the whole occupied
///   range, so every component would collapse onto the two central
///   codes. The same mechanism one rung up is why the original
///   fixed-grid Sq8 lost top-K cosine recall on production corpora.
///
/// The ruler is per-coordinate over the whole plane (not per-cluster):
/// the resident plane is node-ordered across every cell, so there is no
/// cluster to key a ruler on without carrying an assignment per node —
/// and after rotation the coordinates are near-identically distributed,
/// which is what a global per-coordinate fit assumes.
///
/// Scoring is the same fused fold [`Sq16Kernel`] uses, under the
/// [`Metric::NegDot`] convention (`score = −dot`, smaller is nearer):
/// the per-query fold precomputes `q[d]·step[d]` (and its residual-scaled
/// twin) plus the constant offset term, so each candidate costs one
/// multiply-add per nibble straight off the packed bytes with no decode
/// buffer. The kernel is deliberately scalar for the phase-1 recall/RSS
/// measurement; a SIMD nibble kernel is follow-up work if the codec is
